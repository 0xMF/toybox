0xMF Tech Logbook
=================

The purpose of this logbook is document and design forward stuff that I am doing and
want to do in tech. The most recent item will be below this paragraph just so it's
easy to read the latest thing I am working on at the moment.

-----------------------

So I am back to learning Git with all it's attendant problems. I remember learning
it earlier but now I am forced to relearn git so it works with GitHub. Really stoked
that this toybox repository holds a captain's log. 

This file started it's life from a FreeBSD 10.0 Oracle VirtualBox VM running on
Windows 8.1. So today's task was to create this file +captain's_log.asciidoc+ and
upload it to GitHub and correct any errors during the process.
