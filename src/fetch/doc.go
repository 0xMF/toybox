/*
fetch gets Global and User streams from App.Net (ADN) and saves to a local sqlite3 database.

This file (fetch/doc.go) will contain the future documentation for fetch. As that isn't
ready yet so, in the interim, it will act as a design document/TODO/Issues/wish
list/etc.

To see this content as go doc file, run

	godoc fetch
