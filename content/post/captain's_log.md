2015-Jan-12 | Old scripts that work
-----------------------------------
So much of my time is spent on learning new stuff that often I'm just happy when something I wrote
previously continues to work as expected, despite me not touching again for a very long time. All
too often I notice is the case with shell scripts. Once written they continue to work as expected,
and if they are helpful in their documentation on error conditions, then it's all the more better.

Here's something I discussed with a colleague at work earlier today. The notion of a sticky bit.
Sticky bit turned on a directory lets files created in the directory be deletable (if write
permission is given) only by the owner. This is useful in multi-user environments where several
users might want to create log files in a directory but you do not want users to accidentally (or
maliciously) delete each others files.

```sh
chmod +t test 
```

2015-Jan-11 | Hugo Static Site Builder 
--------------------------------------
I had to create a captain's log markdown file because Hugo does not accept AsciiDoc just yet.
