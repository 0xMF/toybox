My git use
==========

As I learn git, with its associated complexities, the time has come to write what I learn in git
in one place simply so I can go back to it later.

Initialization
---------------

There are two ways to do this:

  * start a repo from scratch
  * copy (in git parlance the term clone is used) an existing repo

#### Creates a new repo
```
$ git init repo_name
```

#### Clones an existing repo
```
$ git clone origin_repo_name
```
