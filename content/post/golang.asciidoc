Notes on learning Go
--------------------

(This file contains my haphazard notes to learning Go, expect it to change frequently and randomy as
my understanding of Go improves).

Differences with object oriented programming
--------------------------------------------

Go differs from OOP in the following ways:

  - no inheritance 
  - no parametric substitutuion

The no inheritance problem is solved by creating smaller types and embedding them in others

The no parametric substitution problem is solved with interfaces. The way Go solves this is unique,
and does require rethinking on how the issue of type genericity can be solved in a simple,
minimalistic, working, and future-friendly manner.
